         <p class="placement">Hello! My name is Gabrielle, and this is my personal webpage. I’m majoring in applied Computer Science with a concentration in software development. Some more things about me are.  I’m originally from Louisiana but am currently located in Alabama. I’m 22 years old and am the second oldest of six. I enjoy reading, playing video games, gardening, and playing Dungeons and Dragons in my free time. My two favorite books are “The Martian” by Andy Weir and “Good Omens” by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Me and my friends are currently obsessed with the game The Forest. This season I am growing tomatoes, strawberries, and onions in my raised beds. In Spring 2024 I am taking Introduction to Programming, Advance Programming, Principles of Economics/Macroeconomics, and Psychology of Emotions.</p>
